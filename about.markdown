Hello! My name is Will Schermer, and I am currently at the time of writing this a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am advised by <a href="https://amy.voida.com/">Dr. Amy Voida</a> in the Philanthropic Informatics Research Lab. Broadly, my research looks at the relationships between activist or advocacy organizations and information and communication technologies. I am interested in how activists negotiate the meanings, roles, and uses of these technologies in their work, and how the structure and design of ICTs shapes activist work in return. I approach my projects using qualitative research methods and from Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Critical Theory, and Media Studies lenses.

Outside of this, I do community organizing in Boulder County, watch a lot of movies, hike, and bake. I am currently located in Boulder, CO. Please reach out to me about anything!
